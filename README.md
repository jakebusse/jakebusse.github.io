## Personal Portfolio

This repository serves as my personal portfolio and resume website. I am continuing to update and develop this site as I expand my abilities in web development. This website was developed using React.

## About the Code

I chose to challenge myself for this website to not use a CSS framework or pre-built template. All of the CSS running on this site was written by me. In addition I chose to write many of my own scripts for this site and use as few external libraries as possible, mostly for educational and developmental reasons. I created this app use 'create-react-app' and used the following libraries: 
- [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [react-hotkeys-hook](https://react-hotkeys-hook.vercel.app/)
- [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)
- [GitHub Pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages)

## Dependencies
Run the following in the root folder of the source code to install dependencies.
```
npm install react
npm install react-icons --save
npm install react-hotkeys-hook --save
npm install classnames
npm install gh-pages --save dev    # [OPTIONAL] - Used to deploy app using GitHub Pages

```

## Running the Code
To launch the site on your local machine for development, run the following in the root folder of the source code:
```
npm start
```
Once you have configured your repositories and installed the gh-pages package, run the following in the root folder of the source code to deploy/publish:
```
npm run deploy
```
